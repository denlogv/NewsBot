# NewsBot
Filters important news and sends them via Telegram bot.

I don't like reading unnecessary news and constantly trying to filter out those that are really important from the feed populated with memes and other AI recommended content. Important news can, for example, be information about strikes, new restrictions, new laws and so on. As a computational linguist, I will try to solve these problems with NLP: I will apply zero-shot/few-shot classifiers to the news collected from RSS feeds of some German media.
